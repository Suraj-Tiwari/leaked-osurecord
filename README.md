Hi, I managed to "borrow" DarkImmortal's backup scripts at his server.  
Note: I do did edit anything in this scripts. I do not own this script. Use this with care.  
.  
..

Question: Why did you "borrowed" DarkImmortal's scripts?  
Answer: Its been weeks since the server is not properly working. I got frustrated and painfully ill using Bandicam  
with shit Intel Graphics. I was so angry, even my girlfriend broke up with me because of this.  My grades went lower. 
After more than a year, I went broke. And my mom stopped making me cookies. I lost everything. But there's one thing that didn't lose. 
My anger to DarkImmortal. I put all the blame on him. I blame him for slow internet, I blame him for Global Warming and Kim Jong-un's haircut.  
He destroyed my life. I hope you understand my situation.    
Im trying to restrain myself. I wanted to be a changed man. But DarkImmortal is in my way.  
So please DarkImmortal. Fix the server.
